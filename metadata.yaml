  Jenkins is an extendable open source continuous integration server that
  monitors executions of repeated jobs. The focus of Jenkins is the
  building/testing of software project continuously, and monitoring executions
  of externally-run jobs. More information at http://jenkins-ci.org/.
  
  This charm provides the Jenkins master service, and when paired with the
  jenkins-slave charm provides an easy way to deploy Jenkins on Ubuntu server,
  and scale out Jenkins slaves.
