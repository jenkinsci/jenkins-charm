* Updates from jenkins slaves for labels - would be handy to be able to change
  on the fly - not supported by python-jenkins yet.
* When amulet/juju-deployer support adding/removing storage from a deployed application add tests
  for this. Currently storage support is only tested on initial charm deployment.
